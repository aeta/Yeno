# BTMessages

## Version
2.0

## Build and Runtime Requirements
+ Xcode 8.0 or later
+ iOS 9.0 or later

## Configuring the Project
This project relies on Coccapods, run ```pod install``` before opening ```bt-messages.xcworkspace```. This app should fully function on the Simulator if the host Mac supports Multipeer Connectivity.

## Additional Notes
This app was built in approximately 4 hours, therefore, in the interest of time, common project structures (e.g. MVC) were ignored. Also, some parts of the UI don't fully function or do not provide enough context for the user. This app (at its current state) is not intended for release because of it's instability and lack of communication between the user and app.
